RPM Fusion bsnes package
==============================================================================

bsnes requires firmware/BIOS images to function properly. They need to
be placed in ~/.config/bsnes, in the existing subfolders. The manifest.xml
files contain the info on the correct website.
Some of these files can be downloaded from bsnes website (they are included in
the bsnes archive), some need to be obtained by other means.
